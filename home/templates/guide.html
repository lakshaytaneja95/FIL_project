                    <h4>How to Buy Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies</h4>
                    <p>We understand that it can be difficult and confusing for new users to take their first steps into
                        the world of Bitcoin,
                        blockchain and cryptocurrencies. CoinMarketCap is here to help! We’ve collected information from
                        over 300 cryptocurrency
                        exchanges globally and through that data, prepared a quick guide to help you choose the best
                        crypto exchange so you can
                        finally buy your first Bitcoin!</p>
                    <p>The options available to purchase Bitcoins and other assets do differ from one country to
                        another due to the laws that exchanges operate under. The options to buy Bitcoin with credit
                        cards, debit cards or transfers
                        from a bank account also differ from country to country and between exchanges. Here at
                        CoinMarketCap, we are here to help
                        guide you through those options.</p>
                    <h4>Choosing the Best Bitcoin Exchange</h4>
                    <p>The very first step involves choosing an exchange or trading platform that supports the deposit
                        and withdrawal of your local fiat
                        currency. Many exchanges are localized and only support a select number of currencies. This page
                        allows you to see which exchanges
                        support your currency of choice. Using our extensively collected data from all exchanges, we are
                        able to rank these exchanges based
                        on volume, liquidity (how easy it is to buy and sell Bitcoin) and each exchange’s estimated
                        number of users. We hope this ranking
                        can help you better decide where you would like to buy your first Bitcoin!</p>
                    <p>You can also check if exchanges are licensed and regulated, the different deposit and withdrawal
                        methods they support, their fees
                        and trading commissions and their Bitcoin price. We have conveniently displayed all the
                        information for you to make your decision
                        on just one page. These subjects might sound a little mundane, but it is important to remember
                        that a crypto exchange has to
                        operate under similar rules to a stockbroker. This means that they have very high standards for
                        documentation to comply with
                        the local laws. Certain exchanges might not be a good fit for you because of the country you are
                        from and it is helpful to know
                        that in advance, so that you can choose the best place to buy Bitcoin and crypto for your own
                        situation.</p>
                    <h4>Understanding the Different Payment Methods Available</h4>
                    <p>There are four main methods of depositing local currencies on a crypto exchange. They are:</p>
                    <div style="margin-left: 40px">
                        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; color:#554c4c">
                            <li>Local bank transfers</li>
                            <li>International wire transfers</li>
                            <li>Third party payment processors</li>
                            <li>Credit/debit cards</li>
                        </ol><br>
                    </div>
                    <p>For the first several years, it was not possible to buy Bitcoin or any of the other early
                        cryptocurrencies with a credit card, debit card,
                        or with third party payment processors like PayPal, because it is possible to reverse those
                        transactions. Since a blockchain transfer cannot
                        be reversed, it would have been possible to pay, receive the crypto, transfer it off the
                        exchange and then reverse the payment. This meant
                        that for years, the price of BTC and all crypto was supported by real money with no borrowing.
                        Therefore, until quite recently, it was only
                        possible to get Bitcoins from an exchange with either a local bank transfer or a wire transfer.
